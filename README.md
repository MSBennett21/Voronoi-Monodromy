# Voronoi-Monodromy

Package that computes the Voronoi diagram of the collection of problem points of an algebraic curve. A majority of the code comes from David Clark, Phd (ADD REFERENCE).

Voronoi package contains the Monodromy procedure. This procedure has eight subpackages/subprocedures. Data is an modified version of printdiagram2D. The remaining are nearly identical to the ones given by David Clark.
